# Algorithms
This is a collection of algorithms for consultation and learning.

The folder is divided into two main topics:

- Algorithms;
    - Sorting:
        - Selection Sort;
        - Insertion Sort;
        - Merge Sort;
        - Quick Sort;
        - Bubble Sort;
        - Counting Sort;
    - Search:
        - Linear Search;
        - Binary Search;
    - General:
        - Recursion;

- Data Structures;
    - Nodes;
    - Linear:
        - Linked List;
        - Queue;
        - Stack;
    - Complex:
        - Hash Map;
        - Graph;
        - Tree;
        - Heap;


Naturally, each algorithm is best implemented with different types of data structures, which I'll be doing my best to catalog here.
